Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS)
Overview
The Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS) is a Python-based application designed to automate the process of taking attendance using facial recognition technology. Utilizing OpenCV, Tkinter, and machine learning algorithms, FRAS identifies and records student attendance efficiently and securely.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition using webcam

Automatic attendance logging

Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter

Dataset creation and training module

Attendance storage in CSV files

Technologies Used
Python 3

OpenCV – for face detection and image processing

Tkinter – for building the GUI

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for array operations

PIL (Pillow) – for image handling

System Requirements
Python 3.x

Webcam

Operating System: Windows/Linux


Usage
Create Dataset: Register new users by capturing face images using webcam.

Train Model: Train the recognition algorithm with the collected dataset.
